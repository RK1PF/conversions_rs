# WASM Release Automation Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Updated Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **New `build-wasm` job**: Builds WASM packages for web, Node.js, and bundler targets
- **WASM Release Assets**: Automatically creates and uploads compressed WASM packages:
  - `conversions_rs-wasm-web.tar.gz`
  - `conversions_rs-wasm-nodejs.tar.gz` 
  - `conversions_rs-wasm-bundler.tar.gz`
- **npm Publishing**: Automatically publishes the web WASM package to npm

### 2. Enhanced CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **New `wasm` job**: Tests WASM builds on every PR/push to ensure quality
- Tests all three WASM targets (web, nodejs, bundler)
- Runs the Node.js WASM test suite

### 3. Updated Documentation
- **README.md**: Added npm installation instructions and updated WASM usage examples
- **RELEASE_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive guide for setting up release automation
- Clear examples for both npm package usage and local builds

## ðŸ”§ Required Setup Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets
You need to add these secrets in your repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

**Required for crates.io publishing:**
- `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`: Get from [crates.io](https://crates.io) â†’ Account Settings â†’ API Tokens

**Required for npm publishing:**
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Get from [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) â†’ Access Tokens â†’ Create "Automation" token

### 2. Update Package Information
Make sure these files have the correct version and metadata:
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust crate version
- `package.json` - Root package version (for development)
- `pkg/web/package.json` - Generated by wasm-pack, contains npm package info

## ðŸš€ How Releases Work Now

### Triggering a Release
```bash
# Update versions in Cargo.toml and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### What Happens Automatically
1. **GitHub Release Created**: With changelog and release notes
2. **Platform Binaries Built**: Linux, Windows, macOS executables
3. **WASM Packages Built**: For web, Node.js, and bundler targets
4. **Assets Uploaded**: All binaries and WASM packages attached to release
5. **crates.io Publication**: Rust crate published automatically
6. **npm Publication**: WASM package published to npm automatically

## ðŸ“¦ Available Distributions After Release

### Binary Downloads
- Native executables for all platforms from GitHub releases
- Rust crate from crates.io via `cargo install conversions_rs`

### WASM/JavaScript Usage
- npm package: `npm install conversions_rs`
- Direct download: WASM archives from GitHub releases
- Local build: Using provided build scripts

## ðŸ§ª Testing Before Release

### Automatic Testing
- CI runs on every push/PR and tests WASM builds
- All targets are validated before code can be merged

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test WASM build locally
./build-wasm.sh  # or build-wasm.bat on Windows

# Test Node.js WASM package
node test-wasm.js

# Test in browser using demo
npm run demo
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Set up the required GitHub secrets** (CRATES_IO_TOKEN, NPM_TOKEN)
2. **Test the workflow** by creating a test tag (e.g., `v1.2.0-test`)
3. **Monitor the first release** to ensure all jobs complete successfully
4. **Update documentation** if needed based on any issues encountered

The automation is now ready and will provide seamless releases across all platforms and package managers!
